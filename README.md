# OpenDog_IK
A place for the IK programs of Lafayette's OpenDog

# Library:

1. IK_2D_v3: solves the inverse kinematics for a walking gait in 2-dimensions and animates the result.

2. IK_3D_plot3D: solves the inverse kinematics for a walking gait in 3-dimensions and animates the result on one 3-dimensional plot.  It also involves various walking gaits driven by an "action" and "direction".

3. lidar_test: plots sample LIDAR data and analyzes it for obstacle detection.
